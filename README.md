# About

This project is part of this course: [Build a Project with GraphQL, Node, MongoDB and React.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_), and is the frontend part of the course. It is an event booking site where you can create an account, create an event, or book an event.  I've modified some parts of the project and added new technologies, for example, react hooks and typescript.
  
To see the backend part go to this repository: https://github.com/LGPossatto/graphql-apollo-mongodb-typescript-event-booking.
